		Each char stores links to its fontName and fontSize so what we get is:

		each object instead of allocating 6 bytes (convention above) for string
		and 4 bytes for float allocates 2 bytes for fontNameIndex and fontSizeIndex.

		That means for each char we save 6 + 4 - 2 - 2 = 6 bytes.
		Now imagine we have NUMBER_OF_SAME_TYPE_CHARS = 1000 i.e. with our code
		we will have 3 groups of chars with 1000 chars in each group which will save 
		3 * 1000 * 6 - (3 * 6 + 3 * 4) = 17970 saved bytes.

		3 * 6 + 3 * 4 is a number of bytes allocated by FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder.

		So the idea of the pattern is to move properties shared by many objects to some
		external container. The objects in that case don't store the data themselves they
		store only links to the data which saves memory and make the objects lighter.
		The data size of properties stored externally may be significant which will save REALLY
		huge amount of memory and will make each object super light in comparison to its counterpart.
		That's where the name of the pattern comes from: flyweight (i.e. very light).
